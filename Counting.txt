Sum Rule: If there are n1 ways to do a task in one strategy (A) and n2 ways to do the same task in another strategy (B) where no two ways are same then irrespective of any strategy there n1 + n2 ways to do the task.

Product Rule: Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into two tasks (A and B). If there are n1 ways to do the first task (A) and n2 ways to do the second task (B), we can do the whole procedure in n1 Ã— n2 ways!
