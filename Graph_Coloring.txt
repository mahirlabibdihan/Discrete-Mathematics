Chromtic number: Min number of colors needed for a graph.

Graph with no edges: 1 color.

Simple Cycle:
Odd Cycle: 3 color.
Even Cycle: 2 color. [Bipartite]

Complete Graph: n color(n=number of vertices)
[If there is a complete subgraph of size k,
then we need at least k colors]

Wheel Graph:
Odd Cycle: 4 color.
Even Cycle: 3 color.

Bipartite Graph: 2 color.

Map coloring:
We can not draw a map consisting 5 countrie such that any two of them are adjacent.
We can at most draw 4 countries with any two adjacent.
So we need at most 4 colors to draw a map.
So every map is 4-colourable.
