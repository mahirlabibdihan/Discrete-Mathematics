The Pigeonhole Principle: If N pigeons occupy h pigeonholes and
N>h, then at least one pigeonhole has two or more pigeons
roosting in it.

Generalized Pigeonhole Principle:
If n pigeons fly into m pigeonholes and, for some positive integer k, n > km, then at least one pigeonhole contains k + 1
or more pigeons.

If  N(x) pigeons are placed into N(y) pigeon holes, then there is at least one hole containing at least ceil(N(x)/N(y)) pigeons

Contrapositive form:
If pigeonholes have at most k pigeons, then the total number of pigeons are at most k.m pigeons. (m=number for pigeonholes)


-A player plays 30 days and at most 45 sets of tennis and at least 1 play per day. Prove there is a consecutive span of days during which exactly 14 sets are played.

Let, sj be the number of games player till day j.
1 <=s1   <s2   <.....<sj   <....<s30   <=45   -----> 30days
lets add 14 with everyday. 
15<=s1+14<s2+14<.....<si+14<....<s30+14<=59   -----> 30days

So there are 30+30=60 value of s between 1-59. So two of them must have the same value. (Pigeons=60, Pigeonhole=59)
sj = si+14
sj - si =14
From i+1 to jth day the team played 14 games

1...........i..............j..............30
1<=........si.............sj............<=45
