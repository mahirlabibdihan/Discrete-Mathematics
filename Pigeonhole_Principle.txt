The Pigeonhole Principle: If N pigeons occupy h pigeonholes and
N>h, then at least one pigeonhole has two or more pigeons
roosting in it.

Generalized Pigeonhole Principle:
If n pigeons fly into m pigeonholes and, for some positive integer k, n > km, then at least one pigeonhole contains k + 1
or more pigeons.


If  N(x) pigeons are placed into N(y) pigeon holes, then there is at least one hole containing at least ceil(N(x)/N(y)) pigeons

Contrapositive form: [If the total number of pigeons are at least k.m, then at least one pigeonhole contains at least k + 1 pigeons.] 
If pigeonholes have at most k pigeons, then the total number of pigeons are at most k.m pigeons. (m=number for pigeonholes)


#1 - A player plays 30 days and at most 45 sets of tennis and at least 1 play per day. 
Prove there is a consecutive span of days during which exactly 14 sets are played.

Let, sj be the number of games player till day j.
1 <=s1   <s2   <.....<sj   <....<s30   <=45   -----> 30days
lets add 14 with everyday. 
15<=s1+14<s2+14<.....<si+14<....<s30+14<=59   -----> 30days

So there are 30+30=60 value of s between 1-59. So two of them must have the same value. (Pigeons=60, Pigeonhole=59)[Pigeonhole principle]
sj = si + 14
sj - si = 14
From i+1 to jth day the team played 14 games

1...........i..............j..............30
1<=........si.............sj............<=45

#2 - A player plays 30 days and at most 45 sets of tennis and at least 1 play per day. 
There is a consecutive span of days during which exactly a number of sets are played. 
Find the exact number of sets played for a consecutive days.

1 <=s1   <s2   <.....<sj   <....<s30   <=45   -----> 30days
lets add k with everyday. 
1+k<=s1+k<s2+k<.....<si+k<....<s30+k<=45+k   -----> 30days
So there are 30+30=60 value of s between 1 to 45+k. And two of them must have the same value.(Pigeons=60, Pigeonhole=45+k)
So, 45+k < 60 [ by Pigeonhole Principle.]
45+k = 59 [45+k can be maximum 59]
k = 14
