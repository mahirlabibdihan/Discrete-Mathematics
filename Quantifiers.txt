Universal Quantifier :
∀x => for All x

Existential Quantifier :
Ǝy => There exists one y

Implicit Quantification: 
In mathematics, and more generally, we often make universal and existential statements without actually explicitly using the universal or. exponential quantifiers.


Negation:
~∀xP(x) ≡ Ǝx~P(x)

~ƎxP(x) ≡ ~∀xP(x)
