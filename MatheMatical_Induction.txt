Simple MI:

Principle of MI: Let P (n) be a property that is defined for integers n, and let a be a fixed integer.
Suppose the following two statements are true:

Basic Step: P(a) is true ( Usually 1 )
Inductive Step: For all integers k > a, if P(k) is true then P(k + 1) is true.

Then the statement
for all integers n >= a, P(n)
is true.

(P(a) Λ ∀k>=a(P(k) -> P(k+1))) => ∀n>=a P(n)


Strong MI:Let P(n) be a property that is defined for integers n, and let a and b be fixed integers with a < b. Suppose the following two statements are true:

Basic Step: P(a), P(a + 1), . . ., and P(b) are all true.
Inductive Step: For any integer k > b, if P(i) is true for all integers i with a <= i < k, then P(k) is true.

Then the statement
for all integers n >= a, P(n)
is true.

(P(1) Λ ∀n((∀m<=n P(m)) -> P(n+1))) => ∀n(P(n)
