# how many 4 digit numbers divisible by 11?
=> Smallest 4 digit number divisible by 11 is 1001(11x91).
   Largest 4 digit number divisible by 11 is 9999(11x909).
   Total 4 digit numbers divisible by 11
# how many 4 digit numbers divisible by 11 are not palindromes?

[ Suppose there are n digits in a number a1a2a3....an.
If a1-a2+a3-a4....+an is divisible by 11, then the number itself is divisible by 11.
 Suppose a 4 digit pallindrome is xyyx. Then x-y+y-x=0, which is divisible by 11. ]

=> Any 4 digit palindrome is divisible by 11.
=> 4 digit numbers divisible by 11 that are not palindromes
	= 4 digit numbers divisible by 11 - 4 digit pallindromes

=> 4 digit pallindromes, 
As for palindromes, we have nine choices for the first digit (0 won't do) and ten choices for the second. The first and second digits being set, the third and fourth are determined. Thus there are 9X10 = 10 numbers

=> 4 digit numbers divisible by 11
There are 9000 4 digit numbers from 1000 to 9999 ( or 9X10X10X10)
Therefore 9000/11=818.18 or 819 numbers are divisible by 11.


# How many # 4-digit numbers with at least one 7? ( Leading zero not allowed)
=> Total 4 digit numbers = 9x10x10x10 = 9000
   4 digit numbers without 7 = 8x9x9x9 = 5832

=> 4-digit numbers with at least one 7 = 9000 - 5832 = 3168


# How many # 4-digit numbers with at least one 7?
=> Total 4 digit numbers = 10x10x10x10 = 10000
   4 digit numbers without 7 = 9x9x9x9 = 6561

=> 4-digit numbers with at least one 7 = 10000 - 6561 = 3439
