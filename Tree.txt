An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two of its vertices.
Simple path: No repeated edge or vertice
Full m-ary tree:
internal vertice = i
total vertice = m*i+1

height = h
leaves = l
l  = m^h (Full m-ary tree)
logm(l) = h 
log2(l) = h (Full binary tree) 

l <= m^h (m-ary tree)
logm(l) <= h 

l <= 2^h (binary tree)
