An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two of its vertices.
Simple path: No repeated edge or vertice
Full m-ary tree:
internal vertice = i
total vertice = m*i+1

height = h
leaves = l
l  = m^h (Complete m-ary tree)
logm(l) = h  (Complete m-ary tree / Full and Balanced)
log2(l) = h (Complete binary tree) 

l <= m^h (m-ary tree)
logm(l) <= h 

l <= 2^h (binary tree)
l = 2^h (Complete binary tree) 

Full m-ary tree: Every internal vertex has exactly m children.

m-ary tree: Every internal vertex has no more than m children.

Completer m-ary tree: All the levels are completely filled. 

Balanced m-ary tree: A rooted m-ary tree of height h is balanced if all leaves are at levels h or h − 1.

leaves, l  = m^h
nodes, m^0 + m^1 + …. m^h = (m^(h+1)-1)/(m-1).
