Conditional Statement

If p then q 
p implies q 
p -> q ≡ ~p or q


p -> q: If you don’t give me all your money, then I will kill you.
~p or q: Either you give me all your money or I will kill you (or both).

p : Hypothesis 
q : Conclusion

if p then q .

q if p .
p is a sufficient condition for q .
As we can see that at every true p->q , q is true where p is also true .
Explanation:
In 1,3,4 row p->q is true.
Among these in row 1,3 q is true.
And in row 1 p is also true.
But in row 3 p is not true.
That's why p is sufficient for q but not necessary.
q can be true without p being true.

p only if q .
q is a neccessary condition for p .
As we can see that at every true p->q , p is only true , where q is also true .
Explanation:
In 1,3,4 row p->q is true.
Among these only at row 1 p is true.
And in row 1 q is also true.
That's why q is necessary for p.
p can't be true without q being true.

Implication: p -> q
Negation: p and ~q
Contrapositive : ~q -> ~p
Inverse: ~p -> ~q
Converse: q -> p

Inverse and converse are contrapostive
