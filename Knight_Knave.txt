Knight always tells the truth.
Knave always lies.
1. 
A: At least one of us is a knave
B: <nothing>

Suppose A is knave, 
Then A and B both are knight. (because what A says is false)
A contradiction.

=> So A must be knight.
=> So B must be knave . (because what A says is true)

2.
A: The two of us are both knight
B: A is a knave

Suppose A is knight.
Then B is knight. (because what A says is true)
Then A is knave. (because what B says is true)
A contradiction.

=> So A must be a knave.

Suppose B is knave.
Then A is knight.
A contradiction.

=> So B must be knight.

3.
A: I am a knave or B is a knight
B: <nothing>

Suppose A is knave.
Then A is knight and B is knave. (because what A says is false)
A contradiction.

=> So A must be knight.
=> So B must be knight. (because what A says is true)

4.
A: I am a knight
B: I am a knight

=> No answer.

5.
A: We are both knaves
B: <nothing>

Suppose A is knight.
Then A and B is knave.
A contradiction.

=> So A must be knave.
Then A is knight or B is knight.(because what A says is true)
=> As A is knave, B must be knight.
