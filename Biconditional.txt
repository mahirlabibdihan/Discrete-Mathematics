When converse of a true implication is also true i.e. when both p -> q and  q -> p are true , then p and q are logically equivalent . This is called biconditional  statement .
p <-> q
(p -> q) and (q -> p)
(p -> q) and (~p -> ~q) 

A biconditional statement is defined to be true whenever both parts have the same truth value. 

Truth Table :
p	q	p <-> q
T	T	   T
T	F	   F
F	T	   F
F	F	   T

Biconditional : 
p -> q
p only if q .
q -> p
p if q .
p <-> q
p if and only if q . (IFF)
