Predicates are propositions (i.e. sentences) with variables
And becomes a statement when specific values are substituted for the variables.
Also called propositional function.

Ex:
P(x,y) ::=  x+2=y

Substituting variables with values
x=1 and y=3; P(1,3) is true
x=1 and y=4; P(1,4) is false


Domain: The domain of a variable is the set of all values 
that may be substituted in place of the variable.

The truth of a predicate depends on the domain.

Ex:
P(x) ::= "x is the square of a number"
Domain: Set of positive integers. {1,2,3,4.....}
Truth set: Set of all positive integers which are the square of a number. {1,4,9....}
