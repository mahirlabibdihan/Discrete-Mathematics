Truth table to formula :
1 . Formula is true if the input is one of the true rows .
Look at the true rows and take "Or" .( Efficient when true rows are less then false rows)
2 . Formula is true if the input is not one of the false rows .
Look at the false rows , negate and take "And".( Efficient when false rows are less then true rows)
3. Guess the formula and check the two truth tables. (Not that efficient)

P	Q	P xor Q
T	T	   F
T	F	   T
F	T	   T
F	F	   F

Find formula of p xor q.
1. Looking at true rows: Formula will be true when the input belings to a true(2 or 3) row.
-> (p and ~q) or (~p and q)

2. Looking at false rows: Formula will be true when the input doesn't belong to any false(not 1 and not 4) rows.
-> ~(p and q) and ~(~p and ~q)
