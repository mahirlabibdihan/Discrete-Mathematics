What amount can be form from a and b?

Answer: Can form any amount >= (a*b) - (a+b) + 1

Proof: Let x = (a*b) - (a+b) + 1
Strong Induction:
Base case: x is true

Inductive step: 
Assume m for x<=m<n is true, [Induction Hypothesis]
then prove n
cases: 
n = x+1 : p*a + q*b		[p,q is different for every step]
n = x+2 : p*a + q*b
.
.
.
n = x + min(a,b) - 1 : p*a + q*b

case n>= x + min(a,b):
let, m = n - min(a,b)
So, n = m + min(a,b)
As x<=m<n , so by induction hypothesis m is true
n is also true. ( n>= x )


Example:
What amount can be form from 5$ and 3$?

Answer: Can form any amount >= (5*3) - (5+3) + 1 = 8
 
Proof: 
Strong Induction:
Basis Step: 
P(8)  : 5$ + 3$
P(9)  : 3*3$
P(10) : 2*5$

Inductive step:
Assume for k>=11,for all i with 8<=i<k, i can be formed. [Induction Hypothesis]

To form k, we first need to form i = k-3 and then add 3$.
[ k>=11 , k-3>=8 , i>=8 ]
As 8<=i<k , by induction hypothesis we can always form k-3.
So, k can also be formed.
That means, we can form any amount>= 8$ with 5$ and 3$

{
	Then the statement
	for all integers n >= 8, P(n)
	is true.
}

{
	We have to proof P(k) is true for all k>=11,using P(k-3)
	In weak induction we were using k-1 to proof k.
	But in strong induction we can use anything before k.
	So we are using P(k-3) to proof P(k)

	To form k we need to form k-3 first. We can form i = k-3 whenever 8<=i<k . Therefore as long as k-3>=8,k>=11 the inductive hypothesis holds and the proof is complete.But this means that in order for the inductive hypothesis to	hold,k must	be>=11, so the inductive step doesnâ€™t cover the cases	where k =8,9,10. This is why those were inlcuded in basis step.	

	Thus, 8,9,10 is proofed in the basis step.
	And >10 is proofed in inductive step. As we have proofed for k. And k>10.
	So, every amount>=8 is proofed

Weak Induction:
Base case: 8$ = 1*5$ + 1*3$

Inductive step:
Assume for all k>=8, k can be formed using 5$ and 3$


Case-1: If k can be formed using at least three 3$, then we can form k+1, by replacing three 3$ with two 5$.

Case-2: If k can be formed using at least one 5$, then we can obtain k+1, by replacing the 5$ with two 3$.

So, k+1 can also be formed.
That means, we can form any amount>= 8$ with 5$ and 3$
