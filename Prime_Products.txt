Claim: Any integer n >= 2 is a product of primes
Strong Induction:
Basis step:
2 : 2 is a prime.

Inductive step:
Assume For any integer k>=3,for all i with 2<=i<k, i is a product of primes.(i = p1.p2....pn) [ induction hypothesis ]

Consider k. 
if k is prime, we are done.
Otherwise, k = a.b  
As 2<= a,b <k
By induction hypothesis, both a and b are product of primes.
a = p1.p2.....pn
b = q1.q2.....qm
k = a.b = p1.p2...pn.q1.q2.....qm
k is also a product of prime.
So, for any integer n>=2 , n is a product of primes.(Or prime itself)
